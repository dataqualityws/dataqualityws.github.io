      <h2>QKG@ESWC 2026 — Evaluating, Improving, and Sustaining Knowledge Graph Quality</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        QKG@ESWC 2026 focuses on advancing methods, standards, and tools for assessing and improving the quality of
        Knowledge Graphs and Linked Data.
        As the Web of Data continues to grow in scale, heterogeneity, and importance for AI systems, ensuring reliable,
        interoperable, and FAIR data is more critical than ever.

        The workshop brings together researchers, practitioners, and industry stakeholders to explore quality
        dimensions, AI-supported evaluation methods, and reusable workflows for building trustworthy, high-quality data
        ecosystems.
        QKG combines invited talks, peer-reviewed papers, and an interactive brainstorming session to shape future
        research directions and community roadmaps.
